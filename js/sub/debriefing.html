	<h1>Project Title: Cognitive Stability Flexibility</h1>

    	<p>Background: Performing well on cognitive tasks requires one to focus on current task rules as well as adapt to changes in tasks or the environment. Our study investigates the ability to focus and perform stably, as well as the ability to switch between tasks and perform flexibility. These abilities are referred to as cognitive stability and flexibility. </p>

    	<p>Design: During the experiment, you completed a few tasks with different rules. In some blocks you only did one task - here we were measuring stability. In other blocks, you switched between tasks - here we were measuring flexibility and stability simultaneously. </p>

		<p>Hypothesis: Previous research demonstrates that when individuals are required to switch between rules, their performance on each rule drops, i.e., they make more mistakes or take longer to respond. </p>
		
		<p>This is basic research in psychology. We were not testing or evaluating you. Our interest lies in subjects as a group. You will remain completely anonymous in all our reports. If you have any further questions about this research, please do not hesitate to contact either one of the principal investigators or one of the experimenters. If you have any ethical concerns or complaints about your participation in this study, and want to speak with someone not on the research team, please contact the Research Ethics Board Office, Daniel.tesolin@mcgill.ca or 514-398-5410, citing REB file number 23-12-050.  </p>
